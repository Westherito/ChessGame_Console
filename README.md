I have developed a chess game in C# for the command prompt (CMD) as part of a study project. 
This simple yet challenging game serves as an excellent opportunity to practice chess strategies and enhance skills in this intellectual pursuit.
Use it as an educational tool to learn or teach chess while having fun in the command prompt environment.
